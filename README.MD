** Getting Started **

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language. In this tutorial we will be learning about the basics concept of python programming. 

** Day 1 **

In the day1 part we are going to cover the basic concpet of variables, data types, printing outputs and many more.

    _Numbers_ - Their are two  different types of numbers: 
        a. integers 
        b. floating-point
    
    _Strings_ - A string is a sequence of characters. They are wrapped inside quotation marks(i.e., '' or "").
    
    _Variables_ - A variable is used to store data so that we can use them later in the program.
    
    _Output_ - The print() function is used to display output on the screen.
    
    _Comments_ - Comments are used to ignore parts of the program. In Python, a comment starts with a #.
    
    _Operators_ - Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic such as:
    a. addition +
    b. subtraction -
    c. quotient //
    d. remainder %, etc.
    
    _Data conversion_ - It's possible to convert data of one type to another. For that, we use functions such as int() and float().
    
    
** Day 2 **

Input function in one of the built-in function in python. This function takes input only as string.

    _Get_ _Input_ - The input() function takes the input from the user. The function always takes the input in the string form.


Task 1:

    a. Using input function
       
    Ask the user to enter the first name and store it in the 'first_name' variable.
    
    Ask the user to enter the second name and store it in the 'second_name' variable.
    
    Print the full name.


Task 2:

    b. Arithmetic operation in input function

    Get two numeric type input from the user, convert them to float and assign them to variables 'number1' and 'number2'.
    
    Add 'number1' and 'number2', and store the result in the 'result' variable.
    
    Then, print the square of the result variable.
